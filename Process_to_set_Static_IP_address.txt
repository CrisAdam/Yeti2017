#To set the IP address to Statis you must edit the file /etc/network/interfaces
#To do this, in a terminal type:
#sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
#then replace the current contents with:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.99
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.0.0

#Ctrl-X to save the changes you have made.
#Once changes have been made then you need to restart the Network, and then disable and reenable the ethernet port.
#to do this first run :
#sudo service network-manager restart
#sudo ifdown eth0 
#sudo ifup eth0//you may get the following error: RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument Failed to bring up eth0.

#sudo service network-manager restart

#then you should be good to go
